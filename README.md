Interactive piano game to facilitate children's learning in the areas of language and mathematics while learning the basics of music.

The interaction with the game is through a piano, each key has a push button and a led connected to an Arduino One with the DoReMusic-Arduino.ino previously loaded. The reading of the inputs is sent by serial port. 
The graphical interface is a processing program with proey.pde as main class. Once running the game guides the user through a series of language and math questions as well as piano hero challenges.
